# CSW Sample Objects
This repository is the codebase for the CSW Sample Objects website.

This tool is used to create sample data for custom objects, by allowing to specify the necessary fields, and what it should be filled with.

For example you could say that your object has 3 fields: ID, FirstName and EmailAddress, and specify that ID will be a unique number, FirstName will be a name, and email address will be an EmailAddress and it would send back an object mocking that structure.


## Examples:
**Input**
```json
{
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "FirstName",
            "dataType": "string",
            "type": "name"
        },
        {
            "name": "ID",
            "dataType": "int",
            "type": "unique"
        },
        {
            "name": "EmailAddress",
            "dataType": "string",
            "type": "emailAddress"
        }
    ],
    "options": {
        "count": 2
    }
}
```

**Output**
```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "FirstName": "Alex",
            "ID": 21315,
            "EmailAddress": "alex@example.com"
        },
        {
            "FirstName": "Nick",
            "ID": 21515,
            "EmailAddress": "nick@google.co.uk"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Supported Data Types
Currently these types are supported:

### For Strings

* emailAddress
* website
### For Ints
* unique: This is a unique identifier, no two will be repeated accross all your sample data
* age: A random number between 0 and 100

## Options
You have to pass in an options object that has the following fields. Optional fields will be marked with `*`
* count*: The amount of objects you want in return
